                        I'm passionate about exploring new places and capturing the beauty of nature through my lens. I am also passionate about Software Development. I am a sophomore graduating with an Associates in Software Development in the summer.
                        This hasn't been easy but being able to journey through the world of programming with assistance has been incredible. Coming across website development has made me want to do and learn more about it.
                        Traveling has always been an integral part of my life, allowing me to immerse myself in diverse cultures and landscapes.
                        Whether it's trekking through mountains or strolling along serene beaches, each adventure leaves me
                        inspired and eager for more. This project has also made me more eager to do more web development.
